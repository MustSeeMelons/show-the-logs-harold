## Running the app

- `npm i`
- `npm start`

Note: Windows users will need to install `windows-build-tools` globally, as of writing using version `5.2.2`.

## Building

- `npm run dist`

## TODO

- Error processing (what errors? - not json)
- Themes
- Search in file (similar to filter of logs probably)
